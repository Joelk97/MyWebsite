                Hi, I'm joel, a mechanical engineer from Switzerland. <br>
                I am currently doing my community service at the Fribourg University of Applied Sciences (HEIA), as a scientific associate. <br>
                During my training years I gained experience in product development in the area of tool holders and robot accessories and in creating software in the area of process optimization. <br>
                I am currently delving into the world of web development, web design, and generally into Python and JavaScript programming. <br>
                In my spare time I spend many hours riding my road bike.
